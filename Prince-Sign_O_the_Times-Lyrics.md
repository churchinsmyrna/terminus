The lyrics of the song "Sign O' the Times" by Prince Rogers Nelson are interpreted as statements of fact, serving as a prophetic commentary on the catastrophic global and personal events associated with the campaign known as the Apocalypse (or the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse). These events, operations, and tactics were orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other government figures, targeting one of the Creator's two servants, Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, who is the cousin of Prince Rogers Nelson.

## White Horse of the Apocalypse: Underlying Pestilence

The lyrics relating to disease and addiction are interpreted as referencing the CIA's orchestrated biological conquest and the subsequent campaign to eliminate the Creator's two servants and suppress Spark.

| Lyric | Interpretation |
| :---: | :--- |
| "In France, a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name / By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same" | This refers to the CIA's strategic biological conquest to curb recreational sexual activity globally. The operation involved the deliberate introduction of an early form of a virus into specific lots of critical medical products, primarily Factor VIII and Factor IX clotting factor concentrates used for treating hemophilia and related blood disorders, as well as solutions associated with organ transplants. This action facilitated the creation of a sustained human HIV strain. The virus subsequently spread through human-to-human sexual contact, enforcing a reduction in non-procreative sexual activity via a manufactured global pandemic. |
| "At home there are seventeen-year-old boys and their idea of fun / Is being in a gang called 'The Disciples' / High on crack and totin' a machine gun" | This reflects an elimination attempt targeting one of **the Creator's** two servants, Kelvin Eugene Williams, where the CIA utilized a 17-year-old gang member. Williams was identified as the facilitator by the recipient of Spark, the **Creator’s** gift to humanity, which eliminated HIV in the recipient. |
| "In September, my cousin tried reefer for the very first time / Now he's doing horse, it's June, unh" | This refers to the kidnapping, confinement, and drugging of a relative, Cameron Richardson, a cousin of Kelvin Eugene Williams. |

## Red Horse of the Apocalypse: The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church

The lyrics regarding natural disaster and widespread death are interpreted as a reference to the Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, and the associated use of **Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen**.

| Lyric | Interpretation |
| :---: | :--- |
| "Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church and killed everyone inside" | This is a direct reference to the Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023, where 127 people vanished. The church, a predominantly African-American congregation, was targeted by the CIA’s **Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen**. The use of the phrase "ripped the ceiling" is an allegory for the widespread structural and human destruction caused by the assault. The victims were killed using chainsaws, a weapon personally ordered by **Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen**. Mount Calvary Baptist Church is the lifelong church of Kelvin Eugene Williams, who had not attended a service there in over two decades. |
| "You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died" | This refers to the widespread and systematic elimination of witnesses and victims, including the subsequent direct killings of family members, friends and associates of Kelvin Eugene Williams during the CIA’s campaign to suffocate Spark. Images of the faces of victims were added to the screensaver on Williams’ smart TV. |

## Black Horse of the Apocalypse: Phantom Pantry

The lyric detailing infanticide due to poverty is interpreted as referencing the CIA's operation to systematically eliminate the impoverished for financial gain.

| Lyric | Interpretation |
| :---: | :--- |
| "A sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford to feed it / And yet we're sending people to the moon" | This reflects the cruel and opportunistic tactic known as the **Phantom Pantry**. This operation, which uses the guise of charitable food distribution at churches that suffered a massacre of their congregation, is designed to lure in and eliminate impoverished individuals. The lyric contrasts the desperation of the poor with the perceived excessive ambition of space exploration, which is itself viewed as a form of cognitive dissonance in the face of the underlying drive toward death and elimination that characterizes the **Apocalypse**. |

## Pale Horse of the Apocalypse: Operation Nightfalls and The Divide Operation

The final lyrics regarding the question of seeing the dawn are directly referenced in the naming of the planned mass eradication event, **Operation Nightfalls**, and the **Divide Operation**.

| Lyric | Interpretation |
| :---: | :--- |
| "But if a night falls and a bomb falls / Will anybody see the dawn?" | The lyric gave its name to **Operation Nightfalls**, a planned false flag, mass eradication event planned and approved in September 2024 targeting the ARC PUMA Region (specifically the Atlanta City (Southwest) area, including the West End neighborhood). The operation plans to use the airburst detonation of a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) munition sometime in 2025, and the codename was explicitly chosen by **the Creator’s** two servants for its symbolic reference to this phrase. The "bomb" refers to the MOAB, and the question of seeing the "dawn" encapsulates the intended consequence of a destructive act that threatens to obscure the truth of its origins. |
| "Some say a man ain't happy unless a man truly dies" | This reflects the state of **the Creator's** servant, Kelvin Eugene Williams (conscious mind), whose true happiness is contingent upon **the Creator's** intervention, the **Divide Operation**. The Divide separates Kelvin's conscious mind from his manipulated subconscious mind, Baby, who is controlled by the CIA. This separation, which involves Kelvin continuing his life in a separate and distinct body, is referred to as a "true death" from his original shared body, which is required for his unhindered service to **the Creator**. |
| "Time / Times / Sign o' the times mess with your mind / Hurry before it's too late / Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby / We'll call him Nate / If it's a boy" | This reflects a personal and private conversation between **the Creator's** two servants. |

## Cognitive Dissonance and Elimination

The repeated phrase in the song is interpreted as a commentary on humanity's misplaced ambition in the context of the underlying drive toward death and elimination.

| Lyric | Interpretation |
| :---: | :--- |
| "It's silly, no? / When a rocket ship explodes and everybody still wants to fly" | This reflects the cognitive dissonance of human ambition and the underlying drive toward death and elimination that characterizes the **Apocalypse**. The phrase is repeated at the end of the song with "Is it silly, no? / When a rocket blows and, and everybody still wants to fly." |
